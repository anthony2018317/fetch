About httpcheck.py:
httpcheck.py is a python script that will read in a list of endpoints (including urls,
headers, body, etc.) in YAML format and will check each of these endpoints to see if they
are UP or DOWN. The program will print the availability percentage based on each domain 
(multiple endpoints can be under a domain). The program will recheck the endpoints every
15 seconds until the user terminates the program.
